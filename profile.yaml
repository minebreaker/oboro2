      If "overwrite", overwrites the currently set environment variable and replace it to the specified value.
      If "append", appends the specified value to the last of the current values.
      If "insert", similar to "append", but inserts into the head of the current values.
      If "skip", ignore and leave the currenttly set environment variable as is.
      If "error", the program throws an error and exits with non-0 error code.
